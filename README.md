Prototype Model for Hurricane Prediction
----------------------------------------

Reading GFS analysis from CIRA, without manual feature selection,
the simple model trains a classifier and predicts hurricane locations.

You can get the lastest codes from github with the command:

  git clone 

to run the codes, you can simply start HurrycaneUI.py:

  python HurricaneUI.py
